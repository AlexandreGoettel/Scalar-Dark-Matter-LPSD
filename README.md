# Scalar-Dark-Matter-LPSD
This repository contains code as described in Vermulen et al, 2021. This includes:
- An algorithm for calculating a Logarithmically spaced Power-Spectral-Density (LPSD)
- Examples for how to run the LPSD algorithm
- Code for adding dark matter signals to data for testing. This allows for blind testing

## Licensing:
The LPSD is a modified version of the version found here https://gitlab.aei.uni-hannover.de/geoq/lpsd.
The original version is unlicensed as such we have requested and recieved written permission from the 
authors to use and adapt their code.

We do not provide a license for this version of the code due to the significant similarities to
the original code. However, if you have acquired permission to use the original code then you are
welcome to use our code without further permission.

If you do publish using this code please cite both:
